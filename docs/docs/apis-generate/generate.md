# Generate (Sync)

This API lets you ask questions to the LLMs in a synchronous way.
This API corresponds to
the [completion](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-completion) API.

Use the `OptionBuilder` to build the `Options` object
with [extra parameters](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md#valid-parameters-and-values).
Refer
to [this](/apis-extras/options-builder).
