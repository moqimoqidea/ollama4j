# Generate with Image Files

This API lets you ask questions along with the image files to the LLMs.
This API corresponds to
the [completion](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-completion) API.

:::note

Executing this on Ollama server running in CPU-mode will take longer to generate response. Hence, GPU-mode is
recommended.

## Synchronous mode

If you have this image downloaded and you pass the path to the downloaded image to the following code:

<CodeEmbed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ollama4j/ollama4j-examples/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/io/github/ollama4j/examples/GenerateWithImageFile.java" />

You will get a response similar to:
