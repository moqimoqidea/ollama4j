## Security Policy

### Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest released version of `ollama4j` and the most recent minor version prior to it. Older versions may receive fixes on a best-effort basis.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email the maintainer at:

```
koujalgi.amith@gmail.com
```

Include as much detail as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Affected version(s) and environment
- Any suggested mitigations or patches

You should receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours. We will work with you to validate the issue, determine severity, and prepare a fix.

### Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure process:

1. Receive and validate report privately.
2. Develop and test a fix.
3. Coordinate a release that includes the fix.
4. Publicly credit the reporter (if desired) in release notes.

### GPG Signatures

Releases may be signed as part of our CI pipeline. If verification fails or you have concerns about release integrity, please contact us via the email above.
